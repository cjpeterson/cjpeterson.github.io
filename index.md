## About

My name is Chris Peterson. I am a software developer, amongst other things. I work on whatever I feel like, but my primary interests are simulations and machine learning. I have mostly worked in Java and Python, so far.

Above, you can navigate to the different sections of the site. Projects is my showcase of completed projects and Skills is a breakdown of what I've worked with. Blog is where I post on programming-related topics and Other is where I post on miscellaneous topics. Use Contact if you'd like to send me an e-mail. I am currently open to employment opportunities.
